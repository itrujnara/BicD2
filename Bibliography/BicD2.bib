              The molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein moves a wide range of different intracellular cargoes. Dynein's activity in vivo requires another protein, dynactin, but exactly why that should be has been very unclear. Although in vitro experiments have provided some evidence that dynactin increases dynein's processivity, the resulting dynein motility has never come close to matching dynein's cargo-transporting activity in living cells. Now, {McKenney}
              et al.
              show that tripartite complexes of dynein, dynactin, and an adaptor molecule are highly processive in vitro, moving the sort of distances that dynein transports cargo in vivo (see the Perspective by Allan).

            Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor that transports a large variety of cargoes (e.g., organelles, messenger {RNAs}, and viruses) along microtubules over long intracellular distances. The dynactin protein complex is important for dynein activity in vivo, but its precise role has been unclear. Here, we found that purified mammalian dynein did not move processively on microtubules in vitro. However, when dynein formed a complex with dynactin and one of four different cargo-specific adapter proteins, the motor became ultraprocessive, moving for distances similar to those of native cargoes in living cells. Thus, we propose that dynein is largely inactive in the cytoplasm and that a variety of adapter proteins activate processive motility by linking dynactin to dynein only when the motor is bound to its proper cargo.},

	abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein is the major microtubule minus-end–directed cellular motor. Most dynein activities require dynactin, but the mechanisms regulating cargo-dependent dynein–dynactin interaction are poorly understood. In this study, we focus on dynein–dynactin recruitment to cargo by the conserved motor adaptor Bicaudal D2 ({BICD}2). We show that dynein and dynactin depend on each other for {BICD}2-mediated targeting to cargo and that {BICD}2 N-terminus ({BICD}2-N) strongly promotes stable interaction between dynein and dynactin both in vitro and in vivo. Direct visualization of dynein in live cells indicates that by itself the triple {BICD}2-N–dynein–dynactin complex is unable to interact with either cargo or microtubules. However, tethering of {BICD}2-N to different membranes promotes their microtubule minus-end–directed motility. We further show that {LIS}1 is required for dynein-mediated transport induced by membrane tethering of {BICD}2-N and that {LIS}1 contributes to dynein accumulation at microtubule plus ends and {BICD}2-positive cellular structures. Our results demonstrate that dynein recruitment to cargo requires concerted action of multiple dynein cofactors.},
